# Online Weather Dashboard

## Hello and Welcome to my Weather Dashboard Project!!!

I am currently constructing a live, online weather dashboard for Anchorage, Alaska that includes past, current and forecasted weather. This project extracts data from weatherapi.com, transforms and then loads it to an online dashboard. I am currently using the Streamlit python package to publish the dashboard in browser. 

After the dashboard is up and running, I plan on changing my simple pipeline to something more complex, useful and models a typical workplace solution. Most likely I will be using Databricks, a unified platform that simplifies and accelerates data engineering, data science, and machine learning. This will allow a pipe from the weather data directly into Databricks, and then pipe the transformed data into the dashboard. Using Databricks has many benefits, including:
- Using one of the most popular cloud storage platforms available
- Taking adavantage of Databricks distributive computing, providing incredibly fast compute times
- Modeling my data in a relevant schema as well as a modern data architecture, possibly to a hybrid medallion architecture
- Automate my pipeline, so that this project can live until I'm too old to type, code, or care
