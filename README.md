# Online Weather Dashboard

## Hello and Welcome to my Weather Dashboard Project!!!

My weather dashboard is live! This project:
1. Downloads the current and forecasted weather data for Anchorage using weatherapi.com using an api key (please be kind to my key!)
2. Converts the json data to several python dataframes
3. Extracts the needed data and constructs the wanted framework of the app (I call it a dashboard but its technically an app)
4. Uses the streamlit package to "publish" the weather page in browser (will open automatically in your default browser)

Currently to use this dashboard(app) you need to:
1. Copy/paste my python code to a python file
2. Save it (wont work if not saved!)
3. Download the needed libraries (streamlit, altair, etc...)
4. Run python file in terminal, adding "streamlit run" after "$ python -m" and before the python file name you saved it as

## Next Steps

For next steps, I would like this project to be far easier to use. Eventually, I plan on simply having a button that can be pushed in the README to "publish" the current weather in browser instead of all the above steps. This will include setting up pipelines, automating them and storing the info in a cloud service (Databricks). Due to the complexity of the next part, I may turn this into a two part project and introduce a new repository to save the existing code. (I always use my previous code to help reference current and future code.) **Also, NO AI was used to code any part of this project**.

Credit to [Streamlit.io](https://streamlit.io/) for the idea! They have a similar [demo project](https://github.com/streamlit/demo-seattle-weather/tree/main) that uses historical weather of Seattle where I (clearly) borrowed some of their ideas.
