# Potential Ideas
- Add coordinates
- Fix time font/size
- Add y = 32deg red line on graph
- Add current time on graph (really complex, not sure if streamlit supports this)
- Add some sort of stats project
- Add "feels like" temp to graph
- Maybe change bars to line graph
  - Change gradient to time rather than temp
- Start part two!!! (automated pipeline)
